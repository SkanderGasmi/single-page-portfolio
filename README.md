## Why I Built This

I built this project to practice **front-end fundamentals** and demonstrate my ability to:

* Structure clean HTML
* Apply consistent and responsive CSS styling
* Add interactivity using JavaScript
* Follow detailed technical requirements and evaluation criteria

This project simulates a real-world scenario where a developer must deliver a polished, client-ready portfolio page.
